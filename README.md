# dynamic_QL

This branch contains an implementation of simulated annealing for performing quantum state preparation on a 1D chain. The code is fairly well commented (so dig in !).

# To run #

Download/clone this repository, then run the following command:

```
python LZ_sim_anneal.py 30 20 bang-bang8 out.txt 3000 0.05 100
```
The meaning of the given parameters is explained in the code LZ_sim_anneal.py
